        Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[41] was born on 2 October 1869[42] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family[43][44] in
        Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small
        princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi
        (1822â€“1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.[45][5] His family originated from the then
        village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.
